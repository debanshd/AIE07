##### 🏗️ Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    - Aspect Tested: Rendering of the model's response in the app.
    - Eval: NOT GREAT
    - Observation: Greeted with a wall of text with no formatting, difficult to parse.
    - After:
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points...
    - Aspect Tested: Is the response simple and easy to udnerstand
    - Eval: OK
    - Observation: Answer different everytime; using complex sentences.
    - After:
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: Stability vs variability with repeated prompting
    - Eval: GOOD
    - Observation: Changes eveyrtime within the constraints provided.
    - After:
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: Correctness and methodology
    - Eval: OK
    - Observation: Gave correct answer everytime; Showed method to get to answer; Working not easy to understand
    - After:
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
    - Aspect Tested: Completeness of response, hidden assumptions.
    - Eval: NOT GREAT
    - Observation: Always assumes that user wants an email response, user could want messages.
    - After:

##### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑❓ Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?

> Vibe checking, while useful for a quick first impression, has several key limitations as a formal evaluation tool:
>
> *   **Subjectivity:** The evaluation is based on the evaluator's personal feelings and intuition ("vibes") rather than objective, measurable criteria. This leads to results that can be inconsistent and biased.
> *   **Lack of Comprehensiveness:** By its nature, it is a cursory check and not exhaustive. It's likely to miss edge cases, subtle flaws, and specific biases in the model that a more structured evaluation would uncover.
> *   **Not Reproducible:** Because it's unstructured and subjective, it's difficult for another person to replicate the exact same evaluation process and get comparable results. This makes it unreliable for tracking model performance over time.
> *   **No Clear Metrics:** "Vibes" are not quantifiable. This makes it hard to compare different models or versions of the same model in a systematic way.
> *   **Prone to Confirmation Bias:** An evaluator may already have an opinion about the system, and the informal vibe check may simply reinforce their existing beliefs rather than challenging them.
